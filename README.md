punk.fx
=======

A library for applying graphic effects in FlashPunk v1.6.


Overview & Usage
----------------

With **punk.fx** you can easily apply graphic effects to most of FlashPunk's graphic classes (by using the proper _FX-Graphic_ classes that extend the FP ones) or to whole entities (via FXLayer). 
The library provides a collection of built-in effects (Pixelate, Glow, Fade, etc.), and makes it possible to use the standard Flash filters (DropShadow, Blur, etc.) along with Pixel Bender filters, all just by writing a few lines of code.

You can consult the [wiki](https://github.com/azrafe7/punk.fx/wiki) to get started with **punk.fx** or read the 
full package [documentation](http://azrafe7.github.com/punk.fx/docs) to better understand the library's internal classes and methods.
You can also take a look at this [demo](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32864004/dev/FPDemo/PunkFX%20latest%20demo.swf) to 
get an idea of what this all is about.

  - PBPixelateFX with pivot (pixelates from center by default)
  - added slideFunction to GlitchFX (and a sineWave() example of how to use it)
  - fixed scanLinesOffset: now updates properly
* **ver 0.3.001**:
  - powerful FXLayer added, for applying effects to entities

Special thanks to ChevyRay, Draknek, ChrisKelly (that [firestarted](http://flashpunk.net/forums/index.php?topic=3544.0) me) and all the awesome FlashPunk community, 
Grant Skinner, GreenSock, the PB filters' coders, and the ones that I'm ( _surely_ ) forgetting to mention that helped me 
feed this little creature ( _quite probably unwittingly_ ).
